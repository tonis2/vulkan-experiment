# Vulkan and zig examples

This `zig` + `vulkan` example runs straight from Vulkan C api, code looks good this way in my opinion.

Tested on Linux and zig version `0.9.0 dev`

Requires dependencies `vulkan` and `glfw`

Clone this repo using `--recursive` to also download zalgebra as dependecy

To run use `zig build basic`
