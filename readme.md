# Vulkan and zig examples

This `zig` + `vulkan` example, runs straight from Vulkan C api, code looks good this way in my opinion.

Tested on Linux and with zig version `0.9.0 dev`

Requires external dependencies `vulkan` and `glfw` and zig library `zalgebra`

Clone this repo using `--recursive` to download zig dependencies.

To run example use `zig build basic`
